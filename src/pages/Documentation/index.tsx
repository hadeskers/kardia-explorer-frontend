Staking KAI tokens also help the operation and increase KardiaChain network security. Once you stake KAI tokens, you will earn staking rewards at a certain rate and your holdings will be significantly increased by the power of compounding. It’s better than leaving your KAI tokens without doing anything.</p>

                            Staking is a process of holding KAI tokens in the wallet to support the operations and security of KardiaChain network. As a return, holders will be rewarded with KAI tokens as an incentive.

                   <p className="document-content">Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a similar consensus to PoS that it secures blockchain through an internal investment. The main difference is that DPoS requires stakeholders to outsource their work to a few chosen delegates that will secure the network. DPoS algorithm creates a voting system that reflects delegates’ reputation. There are very first 21 choosen genesis validators for KardiaChain network.
